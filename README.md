Welcome to my repository dedicated to explain the construction of a Trading code using Deep-Learning!

<p>
After writing codes for Algorithmic Trading <a href="https://github.com/trystan-geoffre/Algorithmic-Trading">(Project Link)</a> and Deep Learning codes using TensorFlow <a href="https://github.com/trystan-geoffre/Deep-Learning-TensorFlow">(Project Link)</a> I wanted to combine both in order to build a powerfull tool. 
  

<h3>💫 Model review 🔍 </h3>
  The model has been trained on the S&P 500 data. The model uses Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) layers. Using this types of layer are beneficial for Time Series forecasting as Bidirectional LSTMs can capture context in both forward and backward, furethermore, it improve pattern recognition. The model contains lerning rate scheduler for its callbacks, checkpoints ans an early stopping. The checkpoints permits to save the best model based on validation loss, early stopping preventing overfitting and the learning rate scheduler is here to fine-tune the learning rate as the training progresses
